> An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.
> â€• <cite>Andrew Hunt</cite>

### Quick Bio

I grew up as a child of the 90s in the small city of Portland, Maine. It was there I developed an intense curiosity about the world and a love of the great outdoors. I remember being around seven years old, watching my uncle type some text into the Windows Command Prompt and being completely mesmerized. That of course was followed by the screeching of a dial-up modem.

Computing has fascinated me since. While I decided to study English in college, a love of computing has always been there. I just never quite knew how to express it.

In late 2019, I discovered the joy of programming. The idea that I could create almost anything I could imagine given the proper tools and knowledge was incredibly compelling. I have since taught myself programming through the vehicle of web development using a free and open source curriculum called [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com).

The greatest value The Odin Project has given me is the ability to problem solve on my own--to break down problems into small chunks--but also to know when to ask for help. That, along with an increased capacity for patience, is what gives me the space to grow as a developer.

### Interests

I love music just as much as software development. I have played guitar since the 6th grade and recently taught myself bass. My other interests are running, hiking, and photography.
